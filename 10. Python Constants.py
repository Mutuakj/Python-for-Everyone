#PYTHON CONSTANTS
#This sub-topic teaches how to define Python Constants. 
#NB: Python does'nt have built-in constant type & therefore it does'nt support constants.
#To define a constant in Python, we use a VARIABLE with all letters written in CAPITAL LETTERS. E.g: 
FILE_SIZE_LIMIT = 2000
#The values of variables like these should not be changed.

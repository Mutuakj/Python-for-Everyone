# Using Python for loop to calculate the sum of a sequence
# The following example uses for to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100

sum = 0
for num in range(101):
    sum += num

print(sum)

# How it works
"""First, the sum is initialized to zero
Second, the sum is added with the number from 1 to 100 in each iteration
Finally, show the sum to the screen"""

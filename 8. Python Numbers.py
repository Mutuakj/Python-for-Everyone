#Python supports integers, floats, & complex numbers. In this topic we'll only discuss about integers.
#E.g of Integers; -1,2,3,9,5. Math operators such as +,*,-,/ are used to form expressions including integers.
#Below are some examples...

#In this sub-topic, we'll only discuss about integers and floats.

#INTEGERS are numbers like 1,-4,7,8,3; and they have TYPE int.
#Math operations such as +,-,/, and * are used to form expressions involving integers.
#CHECK THE EXAMPLES BELOW:


# In[5]:


30+70


# In[6]:


90/9


# In[7]:


20*2


# In[8]:


2-50


# In[9]:


#NB: (**) is used to calculate exponents


# In[10]:


#E.g
2**2


# In[11]:


#NB: Parethesis() are used to modify the order of operations. E.g:-
70*(2+3)


# In[13]:


#FLOATS 
#The term float mean that a decimal point can appear anywhere in a number. 
#Therefore, FLOATS are any number(s) with a decimal point. 
#Floats can be used with Math operations just like integers. E.g:
4.35*1.5


# In[15]:


#NB: The division(/) of two integers returns a float. 
#Also, the mixture of a float & integer for a Math operation returns a float. E.g:
200/10


# In[19]:


#NB: In Python, to make digits more readable, UNDERSCORES are used. E.g:
count = 10_000_000_000
print(count)


# In[ ]:


#SUMMARY: - Python supports numeric types such as INTEGERS, FLOATS, & COMPLEX NUMBERS.
        # - Underscores are used to seperate digits to make them more/easily readable.
